  <p>
    I am a writer, educator and sometimes copyeditor. I recently returned to my family’s dairy farm in rural Michigan after years of living and traveling in other continents, states and cities. I graduated with an MFA in fiction from Columbia University in NYC and am currently writing a book of linked short stories that follows multiple generations through the rise and fall of a family dairy farm, kind of similar to the one in the photo. <a href="writing.html">My writing</a> has been published around the internet and in print and was nominated for a Pushcart Prize. I teach freshman writing and work as a writing consultant at a couple universities. Here is my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OP-kZLQ0zI4TGUhyo4bxpDkisqboVlIkMphumwam0P4/edit?usp=sharing" title="See my Resume.">Résumé</a>.
