	<p class="lead">I have ten years of experience writing and three years of experience copyediting, for print and web. I have written content to order and have created orginal content. And I have copyedited technical documents for UN organizations. I&#8217;m looking for work that involves language—whether in a bookstore, as a freelance writer and copyeditor or on a good communications team.</p>
