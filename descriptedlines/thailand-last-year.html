	<p><span class="dc">L</span>ast year I was in Thailand and Vietnam for two months. The sun shone hot, sweat streaked my face even in the dark, I went swimming, we were travelling, it was an adventure. Sifting through the memories I find that I&#8217;m jealous of my tanner and dusty self sitting at street stalls eating soup or biking through an unbearably hot Sukhothai, drinking in <a href="http://amberpaulen.com/descriptedlines/under-chiang-mais-skin">Chiang Mai</a>, <a href="camping-trip.html">swimming over corals</a> and riding the <a href="vietnam-south-to-north.html">train up Vietnam</a>.</p>

	<p>There was a time when I thought my whole life would be made of these series of adventures rather than the adventureless averageness of days. I don&#8217;t know where I got the money from in that hypothetical dream, or where I got the energy. With that said, I&#8217;m aware that my life has been more adventureful than the average, as is anyone&#8217;s who disagrees with the <em>status quo</em>. It&#8217;s always possible to push the limits whether one wakes up in the same bedroom or not. I find that my motionless states give way to the highest creative productivity.</p>

	<p>But anyway, for the last few days the <em>tramontana</em> has been blowing me frozen, whistling under the unsealed windowpanes. If I try, I might be able to imagine that it is the wind blowing by as I&#8217;m sitting behind Simon driving a <em>motorino</em> through the island of Phuket. I am surrounded by the sounds of a market, unfamiliar smells, the stimulus of another country, of Asia.</p>

	<p>In my memory, it&#8217;s difficult to separate my trip from Simon&#8217;s bad luck. On day three his wallet was stolen, on week three a grain of sand busted his camera&#8217;s shutter and near the end, he dove into the water wearing his glasses. And among these were sprinkled more unfortuitous occurrences. I think it&#8217;s safe to say that we had two very different trips: he was happy to return to Italy while I wanted to stay longer. It was as if something was trying to say: you should have stayed home. One begins with the upmost enthusiasm only to have it ravaged.</p>

	<p>One night, smoking and drinking and playing cards, me and our friends pressed him: why all this bad luck, was there anything you did, or took? And then he remembered taking a gold leaf from a shrine inside the Golden Temple the day after our arrival. Many people believe in Luck,  that one can perform a certain series of actions to propagate it. Apparently, taking a gold leaf without the proper rituals is very inauspicious. That night, Simon let it drop from the window.</p>

	<p>Perhaps his story is about how it&#8217;s difficult to assimilate into a place while travelling through it. Or maybe it reveals something about the nature of adventures. Or maybe it simply means: Visitor! Do not take gold leaves from the Golden Temple!</p>
