	<p><span class="dc"><em>T</span>hird or Fourth Day of Spring</em> has within its crumbling black words, all I will ever need. If this piece would be all I&#8217;m allowed of the complete collection of the illustrious <a href="henry-miller.html">Henry Miller</a>, it would suffice. If this piece would be all I&#8217;m allowed of all the great works of all the illustrious writers, it  would surpass that which suffices.</p>

	<p>Flipping through my rough-and-tumble copy of <em>Black Spring</em> seven years ago I settled into page nineteen, reading: <cite>The house wherein I passed the most important years of my life had only three rooms.</cite> The day was like today, the onset of May with rain hanging heavily and grey. I sat under the stone eaves on a stone balcony four flights above via Cicerone, <a href="rome.html">Rome</a>. Could Chance have brought me to this piece at that time? My mind was so fresh, so supple, that in one grand inhale, I digested <em>it all</em>.      </p>

	<p>I continue to digest. Once is not enough. It has been over seven years and I cannot shake those words firing through my senses; seven years and their chorus goes on, unstoppable; seven years and the words&#8217; sharp truth has not grown dull with time, but instead has sharpened the instrument through which I decipher them. <em>Third or Fourth Day of Spring</em> was typed into my lineaments by a man with a heavy hand.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The dreamers dream from the neck up, their bodies securely strapped into the electric chair. To imagine a new world is to live it daily, each thought, each glance, each step, each gesture killing and recreating, death always a step in advance.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As I reread I become maudlin. It is as if the words of this piece are no longer words but have become the fertile earth that has seeded. I believe that everything Henry Miller wanted to say was said in this short piece. I believe that everything that can be said is said in this short piece. I believe there is nothing before and after this piece. <em>Third or Fourth Day of Spring</em> encompasses all.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The world is a mirror of myself dying, the world not dying any more than I die, I more alive a thousand years from now than this moment and this world in which I am now dying also more alive then than now though dead a thousand years. When each thing is lived to the end there is no death and no regrets, neither is there a false springtime; each moment lived pushes open a greater, wider horizon from which there is no escape save the living.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I have found myself on nights of solitude, listening to <a href="http://ubu.artmob.ca/sound/miller_henry/Miller-Henry_Third-or-Fourth.mp3">this recording</a> of <em>Third or Fourth Day of Spring</em>. To listen to Henry Miller read his own words, to listen without reading the words, just to listen, reveals another level of meaningfulness. As I listen I become maudlin. From Miller&#8217;s rambling introduction: &#8220;There crept into it an added intensity. . . fever. . . tempo that I don&#8217;t think the other books had.  It was meant to be a very joyous book though it contains some terrible things. At bottom, what I think I wanted to convey was joy, even more than that, perhaps, ecstasy.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Reading or listening to <em>Third or Fourth Day of Spring</em> is ecstasy; an ecstasy over and above any physical embodiment, an ecstasy over and above my perpetually conceiving self. An ecstasy beyond. <cite>To live <em>beyond</em> illusion or <em>with</em> it? that&#8217;s the question.</cite></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Always summer and everything true to pattern. If it&#8217;s a horse it&#8217;s a horse for all time. If it&#8217;s apoplexy it&#8217;s apoplexy, and not St. Vitus&#8217;s Dance. No early morning whores, no gardenias. No dead cats in the gutter, no sweat and perspiration. If it be a lip it must be a lip that trembles eternally.</p>
	</blockquote>
