	<blockquote>
		<p>In short, I am an idle fellow who pisses his time away. I have absolutely nothing to show for my labors except my genius. But there comes a time, even in the life of an idle genius, when he has to go to the window and vomit up the excess baggage. If you are a genius you have to do that—if for no other reason than to build a little comprehensible world of your own which will not run down like an eight-day clock! — <a href="henry-miller.html">Henry Miller</a>, <a href="third-or-fourth-day-of-spring.html"><em>Third or Fourth day of Spring</em></a></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Ballast overboard! Today all that I have thought is false and all I disagree with is true. No, I can&#8217;t sustain that; I would give myself away too soon, a traitor in the enemy&#8217;s camp, a punk in Gucci, they wouldn&#8217;t even let me in, I&#8217;m a horrible liar. No, it&#8217;s best to just forget about it&#8230; but that&#8217;s what I have been doing. Or maybe, it&#8217;s the heat. Heat has the most marvelous way of making one, lazy. Like a tranquilizer, so easily determined, there&#8217;s nothing left to do.</p>

	<p>Leave industry to the Germans! Let the English lock themselves in office buildings! All watches are Swiss made! This is supine weather, inscrutably Mediterranean&#8230; finally! Please summer burn into me! Melt me into this plastic seat!</p>

	<p>If summer is not the best time to extract the excess baggage—though I am no genius—than it must be spring. But summer is good enough. Thoughts, ideas, like clothes with the tags still on them, what good are they to me! Along with the meal I just ate, out the window, over the side, half-chewed words and rank ideas. See how it lands in that woman&#8217;s hair, she absently brushes the chunk out as she would were it a fly.</p>

	<p>I must. Before I go any further. Before I continue to venture down the impenetrable hole. The rest of this day I will spend puking— <a href="down-to-the-lake.html">down by the lake</a>, to be sure.</p>

	<p>But when I walk down to the lake I&#8217;m always thinking of sentences like this:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Women haven&#8217;t had eyes for themselves. They haven&#8217;t gone exploring in their house. Their sex still frightens them. Their bodies, which they haven&#8217;t dared to enjoy, have been colonized. Woman is disgusted by woman and fears her. —Hélène Cixous, <em>Sorties</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>When I go down to the lake I always bring a book.</p>

	<p>Maybe the best way to get rid of the excess baggage, besides sticking a finger down my throat, would be to get smashingly and stupidly drunk. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what Henry Miller meant, or maybe he did, how do I know? I do know that at some point there should come some relief. Ultimately, and for now, I am saved: there is heat.</p>

	<p>Somedays I think about what a horrible idea it was to begin writing a book. On these days, the temptation to consider that work ballast to be thrown overboard is incredible. None-the-less, I keep plodding on.</p>
