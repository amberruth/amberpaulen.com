	<p><span class="dc">A</span>pparently there&#8217;s this thing going around the writing web called &#8220;The Next Big Thing.&#8221; Since I was tagged last week by writer <a href="http://starkholborn.com/2012/12/12/next-big-thing-part-ii/">Alashiya Gordes</a>, since I never take part in these things, and since I&#8217;ve been looking for an opportunity to write about what I&#8217;ve been writing lately, I decided I would take part. And anyway, why not? Sometimes this website feels as antisocial as I am on my worst days. </p>

	<p>The idea, for those not in the know, is to answer the questions about your work in progress then tag five other writers whose work you like. I&#8217;ve extended the field from writers to include my talented friend who is a leather artist. Enough with the introduction, here are the questions and my answers.</p>

	<p><em>What&#8217;s the working title of your next book?</em></p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t have one. I&#8217;ve always liked titles taken from lines buried in the work and am waiting for that line to rise up. Then I&#8217;ll pin it into title form.</p>

	<p><em>From where did the idea for this book arise?</em></p>

	<p>About a year ago I began to write a short story that I never finished, that instead became chapter two of this manuscript. My ideas for the short story just kept growing, and I realized I had found the small seed of my new project.</p>

	<p><em>What&#8217;s its genre?</em></p>

	<p>Literary fiction.</p>

	<p><em>What actors would you choose to play the part of your characters in a movie?</em></p>

	<p>I have no idea. I&#8217;m horrible with remembering the names of actors or actresses.</p>

	<p><em>What&#8217;s a one-sentence synopsis of your book?</em></p>

	<p>A woman from smalltown, <span class="caps">USA</span>, visits Italy and can&#8217;t go home, her husband returns to thier children, and through her crumbling illusion of Italy she begins to discover herself.</p>

	<p><em>Will you self publish or be represented by an agency?</em></p>

	<p>I hope an agency.</p>

	<p><em>How long did it take to finish the first draft?</em></p>

	<p>I&#8217;m still working! Though I hope this first draft will be by this time next year, which only means I&#8217;ll start to work on draft two, then draft three . . . I&#8217;m not in a hurry.</p>

	<p><em>Are there any other books you would compare this story to?</em></p>

	<p>Though I can&#8217;t compare at all, the books that I am trying to draw inspiration from are <em>Don Quixote</em> by Cervantes and <a href="madame-bovary-x-2.html" title="Madame Bovary x 2"><em>Madame Bovary</em></a> by Flaubert. Also in this same category is Jenn Ashworth&#8217;s <a href="a-kind-of-intimacy.html" title="A Kind of Intimacy"><em>A Kind of Intimacy</em></a>. In each of these the books the main character is so obsessed with their illusion, influenced by their readings, and pursues it to the usually bitter end. </p>

	<p><em>Who or what inspired you to start writing?</em></p>

	<p>Beside the aforementioned sources of literary inspiration, there&#8217;s my love of Italy and the desire to somehow settle the score with all those ridiculous books about its romantic side. I also love to examine what characters do when set down in a place they don&#8217;t know—or in this case, know only through her illusion. I&#8217;m inspired by the challenge of finding a balance between dream and reality, and what happens to one while traveling is how I&#8217;ve most often conceptualize this dilemma. Lastly, I draw inspiration from my curiosity in my own childhood in a small town and what would have happened to me had I stuck around.</p>

	<p><em>What else might interest the reader?</em></p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know. Most of this book isn&#8217;t even written yet.</p>

	<p>And here are my nominations extended to include a nonwriter too, also the only one not in my writing group. Every other week I&#8217;m lucky enough to meet up with these lovely ladies to listen to and discuss what they&#8217;re (or I&#8217;m) writing. </p>

	<p><strong>Amanda Ruggeri</strong>: Amanda is a writer and Rome expat extraordinaire. You can always <a href="http://www.revealedrome.com/">enjoy her knowledge</a> about her adopted home, but she&#8217;s also working on some fiction.</p>

	<p><strong>Kimberly Sullivan</strong>: Since she&#8217;s already been tagged, here are <a href="http://kimberlysullivan.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/the-next-big-thing/">her answers</a>. Her short stories are amazing, and I&#8217;m secretly jealous of how expertly she turns them out.</p>

	<p><a href="http://backstitched.com"><strong>Kimberly Trathen</strong></a>: The only nonwriter of this bunch, Kim sews up some excellent leather bags and wallets using repurposed leather. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, she has recently taken off with a new collection called Shape Shifters. She&#8217;s currently in Thomas, Virginia.</p>

	<p><strong>Rebekah Junkermeier</strong>: Rebekah is going to be the next big name in young adult fiction, I bet. Reading pieces of her work in progress makes me want to figure out how to include a talking chisel into my work too. She&#8217;s currently based in New York City.</p>

	<p><strong>Terianne Falcone</strong>: Terianne is working on a series of short creative nonfiction pieces about life and Italy. Her acting and improv background shed great humor on her pieces. I&#8217;m always eager to listen to and read what she has been working on. I know she&#8217;s already been tagged too, but sometimes it&#8217;s good to bend the rules.</p>
