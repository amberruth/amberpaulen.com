	<p><span class="dc">W</span>ay <a href="rome-s-best-english-bookshop-open-door-bookshop.html" title="Rome&#39;s Best English Bookshop: Open Door Bookshop">back in April</a> I started to write about places around Rome that pleased me. I would like to continue the series, now that my grammar course is nearing a close, with something that&#8217;s my favorite wherever there&#8217;s freshness: fruit. And more specifically, variety of fruits. Lucky for me, Italy is a cornucopia of freshness in all seasons according to the seasons. Don&#8217;t think about peaches in winter; don&#8217;t expect oranges in summer. And unlike my native Michigan with its wonderful berries, in summer Rome excels in stone fruits in all varieties.</p>

	<p>You would think peaches are only peach in color but not here: they&#8217;re also white or yellow. And the plums. I used to think there was only one type and taste of plum: glossy purple on the outside, golden on the inside. Was I wrong! My local fruit vendor on any given day sells at least four varieties, not counting the ones that have a short fruition and then go out. There&#8217;s yellow, green, small pink, big pink, familiar round purple, longish purple, longish pink. And I don&#8217;t know if its only the Romans who named them thus, but these fruits have catchy names.</p>

	<p><img src="_images/254.gif" alt="White Grapes and Apricots" width="500" height="333" /></p>

	<p class="caption">Today Mauro was bereft of plums—after all, it&#8217;s August—so here&#8217;s some grapes and apricots instead.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Regina Claudia</em></strong>: Named after Queen Claudia, this green-on-the-outside, greenish-yellow-on-the-inside plum is a wonder to bite. It has a taste that&#8217;s sweet and delicate and so distant from those normal Michigan plums, I have no question why it has been named after royalty. Apparently the <em>Regina Claudia</em> is an old line of plum. </p>

	<p><strong><em>Coscia di Monaca</em></strong>: Named after Monk&#8217;s thighs for their unwieldy and generally inelegant shape. A cloudy pink on the outside and toasty yellow on the inside, this plum leans towards bitter more than sweet. They are at their best when they&#8217;re hard to bite into.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Sangue di Drago</em></strong>: Take a bite into this plum and you won&#8217;t have any questions about how it got its name of dragon&#8217;s blood. The inner flesh is bright red in color and tastes as startling as it looks. It has a bright sweetness that doesn&#8217;t overwhelm. Outside it&#8217;s molted red and green.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Goccia d&#8217;Oro</em></strong>: This is as normal as it gets with plums here. Small and usual, the &#8220;Drop of Gold&#8221; plums&#8217; taste neither sparkles or fails. They can be eaten quickly and abundantly on a hot summer&#8217;s day.</p>

	<p>If you find yourself near the Colosseum in any month but August, find <em>Via Quattro Santi Coronati</em> and walk in the direction of the church to Mauro&#8217;s fruit stand. Buy a bag of plums, if it&#8217;s summer, and experience the variety you&#8217;ve been missing.</p>
