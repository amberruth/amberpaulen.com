	<p><span class="dc">I</span>n <a href="reading-like-a-writer.html" title="Reading Like a Writer"><em>Reading Like a Writer</em></a> Francine Prose writes so much of Heinrich von Kleist in her chapter titled &#8220;Characters&#8221; that I have been on the lookout for his books ever since I put her book down. And lucky for me I found this Hesperus edition in a bargain bin. With three pieces—one novella <em>The Marquise of O–</em> and two stories, &#8220;The Earthquake in Chile&#8221; and &#8220;The Foundling&#8220;—this slim edition served as a perfect introduction to this strange writer. Have a read of his opening sentence to <em>The Marquise of O–</em> to see what I mean by strange:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In M–, an important town in northern Italy, the widowed Marquise of O–, a lady of excellent reputation and mother of several well-bred children, had the following announcement published in the newspapers: that she had, without knowing the cause, come to find herself in an interesting condition, that she wished the father of the child she was expecting to present himself; and that she was resolved, out of consideration for her family, to marry him.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>First published in 1808, it&#8217;s easy to imagine the type of controversy stirred up by a story like this. Even now, over two hundred years later, I found myself shocked and awed at its passionate turns and surprised that this old story has so much sex and violence. The reaction of the Marquise&#8217;s family to her mysterious pregnancy fit the time, but what doesn&#8217;t is that because the Marquise is innocent, more questions are forced into the picture than most dare answer. </p>

	<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s only the influence of the mysterious pregnancy that causes not one of these characters to act stereotypically. How rewarding to read a book where no one acts predictably! I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever gasped out loud before as much as I did reading this story. </p>

	<p>&#8220;The Earthquake in Chile&#8221; starts off with another bang:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In Santiago, the capital of the kingdom of Chile, at the precise moment of the great earthquake of 1647, which cost many thousands of people their lives, a young Spaniard called Jerónimo Rugera, who had been accused of a criminal offence, was standing beside by a pillar in the prison, where he had been incarcerated, and was about to hang himself.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This story is also rich with sex and violence, but unlike <em>The Marquise of O–</em> it builds up to the shock and awe of the end. (Maybe I would have been more shocked at the end of <em>The Marquise</em> if Francine Prose hadn&#8217;t given away the ending.) Though the earthquake in the beginning is also vivid and horrible, it&#8217;s the ending I don&#8217;t recommend reading before going to sleep. </p>

	<p>Heinrich von Kleist is one of those writers I feel as if I should have heard about earlier. The writer he is most famous for influencing is Kafka, but he must have touched many other Germans. As a person, Von Kleist seems as weird as his stories. In 1811 he sailed out to the Wannsee, shot Henriette Vogel dying of cancer, and then shot himself. Theirs was a love-and-suicide pact made out of misery. Sometimes I wonder if such fanaticism isn&#8217;t necessary for writing such fascinating stories. In any case, his early death left less works of von Kleist&#8217;s to read and more time to read these stories again.</p>
