	<p><span class="dc">S</span>o my editor at The American didn&#8217;t think this was publishable material. He says conversations like the following don&#8217;t pull in the reader because there isn&#8217;t any context. I agreed with him and started writing something, but I&#8217;m going to put this up here anyway. Because though the conversations may be difficult to follow, I think they are a good description of our trip to Amsterdam last weekend.</p>

	<p>Finding food is complicated in any country.</p>

	<p><strong>Me:</strong> Where should we eat?<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> I&#8217;m craving eggs and bacon. Let&#8217;s eat at that place we ate at once with Kim and Ryan. Do you remember? <br />
<strong>Kari:</strong> I would eat eggs and bacon.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> I know, I&#8217;m hungry. I remember that restaurant—it was great. But how will we find it? I don&#8217;t know where we are, though this area does look kinda familiar.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> All the streets in Amsterdam look familiar. Canals, boats, trees, benches, thin brick houses. And the streets go around in a half circle. The last time I was here alone I got so lost. I came back to the same square so many times that I thought I was in the movie Groundhog Day.<br />
<strong>Kari:</strong> (laughs) Aren&#8217;t the canals so charming? I want to be in a boat, like them, (Kari points at a small boat chugging through the canal) with a glass of wine already. What a great way to spend a Sunday.<br />
<strong>Dad:</strong> Next time babe.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> What about this restaurant? It looks good, and I&#8217;m so hungry. I really don&#8217;t care where we eat.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> It&#8217;s too food nouveau. Too glass and metal.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> We&#8217;re going to walk forever if you&#8217;re looking for that particular place.<br />
(Simon walks ahead and stops at the next corner. Waves his hands.) <br />
<strong>Dad:</strong> Looks like he found it!<br />
<strong>Kari:</strong> Yum, looks good, and I love it here. The small counter and chairs, and the food smells delicious.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Sorry I doubted you. I&#8217;m just so hungry.</p>

	<p>In the bookstore.</p>

	<p><strong>Me:</strong> I read online that this book has gotten really popular here in The Netherlands all of a sudden.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> <a href="stoner.html" title="Stoner">Stoner</a><br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s so strange. It was written in the mid-60s by an American, John Williams, and it was never even this popular in the States. But I&#8217;ve seen it all over the bookstores here.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> It&#8217;s about stoners. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s popular here.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> No. It has nothing to do with stoners. It&#8217;s about an academic. The plot seems like it would be really boring, nothing much happens to the main character. His last name is Stoner. But it&#8217;s a great book.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> Aren&#8217;t people disappointed it&#8217;s not about stoners?</p>

	<p>Walking in Amsterdam in early June can be cold.</p>

	<p><strong>Kari:</strong> I&#8217;m so glad I packed this down vest. I grabbed it at the last minute with the only closed shoes I brought. The weather was predicted to be 70 degrees here. Boy was it wrong!<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> I always pack clothes that are too light. But this sweatshirt I bought saved me.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> It&#8217;s the wind. It must be blowing off the North Sea.<br />
<strong>Kari:</strong> I think your dad needs a scarf.<br />
<strong>Dad:</strong> Why? Because I&#8217;m all hunched up.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> You have to be freezing. You&#8217;re only wearing that jacket. Here, take my scarf and hat.<br />
<strong>Kari:</strong> They look so good on you! We&#8217;re going to get you a scarf.</p>

	<p>Walking in Amsterdam can also be hazardous.</p>

	<p><strong>Simon:</strong> We made it across the Leidseplein!<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> I can&#8217;t believe it. Bikes, trams, pedestrians coming from all directions.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> The problem is everything&#8217;s so silent. You can hardly hear the bikes or trams coming until they&#8217;re right in on top of you, ringing their bells. <br />
<strong>Me:</strong> But look how few cars there are. I wouldn&#8217;t mind living in a city like this. It&#8217;s hardly a city. It&#8217;s so small, smaller than Rome.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> And it&#8217;s so organized. <br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Organized chaos. Everyone sticks to their particular lane.</p>

	<p>And only in Amsterdam.</p>

	<p><strong>Me:</strong> Look at this article about two sisters.<br />
<strong>Simon:</strong> &#8220;A combined century of work between the two of them.&#8221; And now they&#8217;re retiring. Here Jeff, read this. <br />
<strong>Dad:</strong> Look at these women! It says that the younger sister was seen a month ago still waving to customers from her window in the Red Light District.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> And the older retired earlier because of arthritis.<br />
<strong>Dad:</strong> I can&#8217;t imagine they were still working. Who would sleep with them?<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Maybe all their experience kept them in demand.<br />
<strong>Kari:</strong> There were some surprisingly unattractive women in the windows when we passed through.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> What a weird city.</p>
