		<p>&#8230;I was, and am still, totally unable to understand the meaning of the word &#8220;conviction.&#8221; My knowledge that the practice of vivisection, for example, is a crime against everything that is noblest in our race, is not a conviction, <strong>it is my life</strong>. Goethe cursed Eckermann once for asking him what was the main &#8220;idea&#8221; in Faust.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;Do you suppose,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that a work into which I&#8217;ve put <strong>my life</strong>, would condescend to so poor a category of living value as a mere idea?&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		<p>And I would say the same when people ask me for proof that these miserable dogs suffer.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;With my whole being I <strong>know</strong>,&#8221; I answer them&#8230;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		<p>That is really how we all know that all evil is evil. You can find reasons to defend anything.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This quote of John Cowper Powys from <a href="autobiography.html"><em>Autobiography</em></a> inspires two thoughts in me.</p>

	<p><strong>The First</strong>: The obvious relation to writing into which the writer writes with his/her <em>whole life</em>. I have written about this before, <a href="the-meaning-of-meaning.html">here</a> for instance; I have written that I believe it impossible to study &#8220;creative&#8221; studies. The contemporary way of going about art is in the accumulation of degrees and workshops and asked for praise and acclaim. Most writers I run into on their sites, have mile-long lists behind their names. This is an embarrassment, for instead of art becoming something which we can all pour <em>our lives</em> into it has become something for academia, which just another word for bull-shit. These factory made writers write on the assembly line of a singular idea that appears pretty on paper; that it is an <em>opera</em> is a far cry: It Stinks!</p>

	<p>How do we come to such dribble? How do we counter such dribble? I believe it all comes down to what John Cowper Powys describes as his <a href="porius-again.html">&#8216;life-illusion&#8217;</a>. Once we have firmly grasped our own &#8220;life-illusion&#8221;, chiseled out from life itself, then we can write with our <em>whole lives</em> for the words which would pour forth would be. Yes, that&#8217;s it, &#8220;would be, &#8220; just as we are. Until then it&#8217;s poking around in the dark, false conclusions and gross lies. Paperbacks to appease the people, cooked up like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonalds">McDonald&#8217;s</a> hamburgers. I think I&#8217;ll pass.</p>

	<p><strong>The Second</strong>: How do we know all evil is evil? Each to our own evil, that&#8217;s what it implies. The other night I found evil while perambulating around in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/health/22fblogs.html">&#8216;fatosphere&#8217;</a>, evil in Meme Roth. I&#8217;ve never heard of this horrible witch before, I wish I hadn&#8217;t. Just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdPXlW3zGfo&amp;feature=related">watching her speak</a> makes me want to turn her off, which I did. What is she suggesting? That women should come in one perfect size which equals health? That women should not embrace their fat, fat on each woman, for women are fat; not embrace who they are? But enough already about that evil wraith, I would rather write of the good stuff I found.</p>

	<p>The fat acceptance movement is one of the best movements to hit women. Beautiful bodies <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFmVj5BXCxM">no matter what</a>. With <a href="http://fatrantblog.wordpress.com/">real</a> <a href="http://kateharding.net/">fat</a> <a href="http://anybody.squarespace.com/anybody_vent/2008/6/23/introducingvelvet-damour.html">women</a> propelling the whole thing, speaking out with their experience of being at the ass-end of our body-obsessed society. It is very heartening for it speaks out to all women who have thought: I should loose some weight; to anyone who has thought: If only I looked like ______, if only I could change _______.  It speaks: Accept yourself for who you are. </p>

	<p>These women do not speak from a &#8220;mere idea,&#8221; they are speaking from <strong>their lives.</strong></p>
