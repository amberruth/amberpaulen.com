	<p><span class="dc">T</span>he other evening I listened to the <a href="http://thislife.org/">This American Life</a> podcast: <a href="http://thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=137">The Book that Changed Your Life</a>, and it got me thinking. I wondered if I had been changed by a book, I mean, I&#8217;ve had to have. Books have played such an important part in my life that one book in particular must stand out amongst <a href="goodbooks.1.html">the rest</a> in the form of before-book and after. <a href="reading/the-brothers-karamazov.html"><em>The Brothers Karamazov</em></a>? <em>The Secret Garden</em>? <em>The Prime of Life</em>?</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I do not believe that one can be changed by a book (or by a person) unless there is already something present, latent or in embryo, ready to be changed. — <a href="doris-lessing.html">Doris Lessing</a> in an essay out of <em>Time Bites</em>, <em>A Book that Changed Me</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I can with the utmost surety say that <a href="henry-miller.html">Henry Miller</a> changed my life; but he is not a book. He was a man who wrote truthfully, there is no space between him and his pages. I see that it is easy to get him confused with the books he has written; I can&#8217;t pull apart one of his books from another. I can&#8217;t say it was <a href="third-or-fourth-day-of-spring.html"><em>Black Spring</em></a> and not <a href="sexus.html"><em>Sexus</em></a> which caused the pivot around which my life began to turn, I can&#8217;t. Before Henry Miller I had vague definitions of writer; after Henry Miller I understood that my quirks and my desires pinned me as one. After Henry Miller I was able to say, &#8220;If he tried then I may as well.&#8221; And so I read the way he did it and went his way myself. Everything is post-Henry Miller. But he&#8217;s not a book.</p>

	<p>Has a single book changed my life? Why yes! A type of change that the podcast did not mention. The book that has changed me is <a href="tblm.html">the book</a> I am writing.</p>

	<p>Since the two plus years I&#8217;ve gotten down to it, devoted of myself as much as I could devote, I see (somewhat), now nearing the (hopeful) end of this process, what it has done to me. What has it done? It&#8217;s changed me. Of course all this could be said about writing as a whole, but a singular concentration on a singular work over years has the great potential of working like therapy. More than ever I feel my vision expanding, a greater understanding of how to deal with myself in the world—or am I just getting older? Whatever the solid proofs are, most of my changes are not. They are of those same visceral substances that perpetually elude me: why I write.</p>

	<p><strong>Note</strong>: I&#8217;ve written a new <a href="about.1.html">About Page</a>, which I like much better.</p>
