	<p><span class="dc">I</span>t&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve had as complicated a relationship with a book as the one I&#8217;ve had with Virginia Woolf&#8217;s <em>Orlando</em>. The novel is denser than I first thought to look at it, but once I began to read I began to understand what I was getting myself into. Though Virginia Woolf deemed the writing of <em>Orlando</em> as a &#8220;writer&#8217;s holiday,&#8221; the reading of it wasn&#8217;t much of a holiday for me at all.</p>

	<p>Many years ago I tried to read <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> and made it a meager five pages through—I had better luck with <em>Ulysses</em>. I wonder if my problems with <em>Orlando</em> came from some aversion I have to Virginia Woolf&#8217;s prose, though I can&#8217;t say where the aversion lays exactly. She&#8217;s not as long-winded as <a href="john-cowper-powys.html" title="John Cowper Powys">John Cowper Powys</a>, not as preachy as <a href="dh-lawrence.html" title="DH Lawrence">Lawrence</a>, not as poetical as <a href="annie-dillard.html" title="Annie Dillard">Annie Dillard</a>, and her paragraphs aren&#8217;t as long as Gabriel García Márquez&#8217;s. <em>Orlando</em> isn&#8217;t her most lyrical (or so I&#8217;ve heard); it&#8217;s written in the style of biographical parody. There are many events that happen but not a lot going on. There is an interesting premise: Orlando begins the book as a male and halfway through transforms into a female; Orlando lives for four hundred years or so, from the 1500s to the present day (1928). There are even pictures, but yet&#8230;</p>

	<p><em>Orlando</em> was written as a mock biography based on the life of Virgina Woolf&#8217;s friend Vita Sackville-West, a woman who descended from an old English family line, who had an enormous manor, and who took women as lovers while married to a man. <em>Orlando</em> follows Vita&#8217;s life in a roundabout way, clasping to the implication and outline of events more than the events themselves. </p>

	<p>Perhaps I had trouble with this book because I didn&#8217;t find Vita&#8217;s or Orlando&#8217;s life to be very interesting. Orlando grows up in England, makes friends with a queen, falls in love with a Russian princess, goes back to his big house, leaves his big house, tries to write, moves to Constantinople, and it&#8217;s a relief when he finally becomes a she. She moves back to England, tries to write, makes friends with writers, etc.</p>

	<p>Yet the premise is interesting. When Orlando transforms from a he to a she, during a sleep of seven days, we readers are suddenly faced with another pronoun to describe the character whom we thought we knew and whom we thought gender defined. And as a result, this transformation opens up a discussion about what it was like to be a woman or a man; the disadvantages and privileges of life as one or the other (or both) during the present and the many centuries Orlando was alive for. (<em>A Room of One&#8217;s Own</em>, an influential feminist tract, directly followed <em>Orlando</em>.) </p>

	<p>Like Orlando blurs gender, so he/she blurs through time.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And it is the combination of these two ideas that made reading  <em>Orlando</em> worth it in the end. The time and gender shifts are close to reality despite their fantastic nature. For this reason I&#8217;m still willing to give Virginia Woolf another try, but maybe in a year or two.</p>
