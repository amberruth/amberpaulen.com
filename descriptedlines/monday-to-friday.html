	<p><span class="dc"><strong>M</span>onday:</strong> Waking, in a small town in <a href="in-the-mountains.html">the Jura, France</a>. Sweet sunlight and luckily no hangover, grass clinging to my sweater from <a href="categories/index.html#starwatch">stargazing</a> on my back the night before, and drinking. We breakfasted, then cleaned the country house, striped its beds and swept the floors; six adults make for a speedy team. </p>

	<p>Our plane lifted off from Geneva, but first we had to deposit the rental car in a confusion of country borders: one part of the airport is in France, the other in Switzerland, strange. Always coming out of the metro <a href="colosseum-as-traffic-circle.html">at Colosseo</a> and seeing that great old amphitheatre that welcomes me &#8220;home.&#8221; The Colosseum? home? And we opened the door to a happy black cat.</p>

	<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Work and writing and reading. For dinner: small fried fish and shrimp, heads and all.</p>

	<p><strong>Wednesday evening:</strong> A conversation with Marilyn Hacker, the poet, in Trastevere. A small woman with a great intellect sat at the front of a small audience talking. She said, &#8220;When I was eleven and was allowed to go to the museums alone&#8230;&#8221; And, &#8220;When I was four and a half I got my first library card&#8230;&#8221; New Yorker, I guess. She said, &#8220;Poetry is all about form.&#8221; When asked if she had any advice for burgeoning and aspiring and mostly failing poets, she responded, &#8220;Read and read and read, and it helps to learn another language.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I attended that &#8220;conversation&#8221; with many thoughts, none sticking, about how I don&#8217;t know writing at all yet, or maybe I knew it better when I sat alone and wrote and thought nothing of what happens to the finished product. What happens to a finished story but return like a boomerang?—Ouch!—I thought about a secondhand quote from Anthony Doerr that said something like, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to get a sunburn on your neck if you look up too much.&#8221; I walked through Trastevere looking straight ahead. Step, step, ahead. Only I turned in at the bookstore to purchase a bag full of words: <em>Names</em> by Marilyn Hacker, <em>In a Strange Room</em> by Damon Galgut, <em>The Progress of Love</em> by Alice Munro. Research.</p>

	<p>I opened the door to a happy black cat, my mind astir with words. We ate steak with zucchini for dinner.</p>

	<p><strong>Yesterday:</strong> June 2, Republic Day in Italy, holiday. The streets quieter than a Sunday, deserted, the open windows only letting in a breeze. I read <em>Bastard Out of Carolina</em> with my coffee. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FrecceTricolori01.jpg"><em>tricolori</em></a> tore like bass-deep wind above the apartment before lunchtime, streaming red, green and white exhaust, how patriotic!</p>

	<p>Sweet lazy summer day, sweet summer rainfall, cool splashes on my arm like cool fingers, gelato on the walk to the Palazzo Esposizioni to see 100 Capolavori: Oh! Degas and Renoir and Delacroix and that massive portrait of <a href="italian-journey.html">Goethe</a> by Tischbein, reclining on the ruins of Rome, the <em>campagna</em> behind him. The perfect number of paintings to view, a great collection! For dinner: <em>pizza con pepperoni</em> (i.e. roasted red peppers) and a movie.</p>

	<p><strong>Today:</strong> Half over. Half begun? I&#8217;m not so optimistic. To do: send some submissions, take a walk to <em>Celimontana</em> the park where I&#8217;ll listen to the bright green squawking of the nesting parakeets as I read: <em>Bastard Out of Carolina</em>, poems by Marilyn Hacker or <a href="poetry-reading-joseph-harrison.html">Joseph Harrison</a>, a short story by Alice Munro. Tonight for dinner? An evening stroll? Night by the Colosseum. </p>

	<p>And I&#8217;m thinking still: stay looking straight ahead.</p>
