	<p><span class="dc">T</span>his summer I took China Miéville&#8217;s <em>Perdido Street Station</em> for <a href="http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?article=3949">a week on the beach</a>. The book had long sat on my shelf, lent to Simon from a friend. Its black cover with a single wing and bold yellow lettering out of place besides the comparatively gentle titles and covers of paintings or photos of people. The cover suggests Icarus, and I imagined inside was a modern story laid over the myth. And this, even though the blurb on the back page insisted otherwise.</p>

	<p>I didn&#8217;t come to the book completely unprepared. A few years ago I read <a href="embassytown.html" title="Embassytown">Miéville&#8217;s <em>Embassytown</em></a> when it came out. But as I know now that was sci-fi leaning toward literary fiction, while <em>Peridido Street Station</em> is sci-fi leaning toward fantasy. As far as fantasy goes, I&#8217;ve read the requisite <em>Lord of the Rings</em> but that&#8217;s all. Fantasy is a strange beast to me—and even stranger now that I&#8217;ve read something contemporary. </p>

	<p>When I started the book—and it&#8217;s got a starter: the protagonist is having sex with his girlfriend who&#8217;s head is actually a beetle—it felt like I had been tossed into a cold sea. There was a strange sensation of not understanding, of struggling to get a grip on what the writer was talking about, of not having any ballast in the vastness of the story. And it made me realize that I usually come to my reading knowing a lot already, from the big, general swoop of the narrative arch to the guarantee that some flawed character will go through some trial (not to say <em>Peridido Street Station</em> didn&#8217;t have both of these but that there was so much going on that they didn&#8217;t seem as important). </p>

	<p>After I got over the general squalor that the book likes to revel in (Miéville excels at disgusting descriptions) and all the action, I began to enjoy the blankness of letting the book take me where it would. And it did, and I never got completely comfortable with it, always conscious of the sensation of reading something strange. My reading had a kind of double vision—I was reading and reading how I was reading, something that never happens when I read my usual. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s a good experiment to try for both writer and reader: find a book that might make you uncomfortable and then read it. </p>
