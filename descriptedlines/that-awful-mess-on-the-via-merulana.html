	<p><span class="dc">G</span>adda is one of those writers whom when I finish reading I wonder, How has he slipped through my fingers? Why have I not heard his name mentioned before? Why is he not mentioned more? The literate Italians know him, but outside there seems to be a deficit.</p>

	<p>While reading online for <a href="clash-of-civilizations-over-an-elevator-in-piazza-vittorio.html"><em>Clash of Civilizations over an Elevator in Piazza Vittorio</em></a> I came across a comparison with <em>That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana</em>. Odd, besides long titles, unsolved murder and Rome, these two books have little else in common. Gadda holds a spell over language. While reading <em>That Awful Mess</em> I was aware of the challenge to the translator (William Weaver), as aware of how much I missed in original Italian. Gadda is an inventor, a wielder of dialects, he plays on word combinations, subtly mentions art and politics, he flaunts irony like a pair of chickens. The nearest comparison is Céline, a contemporary. But, Gadda equals only Gadda.</p>

	<p>What distinguished Gadda for me on this first reading were the verbal flights into and away and around his main plot; from one page to the next it was impossible to tell what would follow. Unpredictable, sure, but even better: free-form, the mind in flight, swooping in and out and up and down, elusive, where the wind takes you! And then, mama mia! even better, <em>That Awful Mess</em> does not end. The reader delightfully strolls down via Merulana until the sidewalk breaks off, the book simply gives way.</p>

	<p>The lack of an ending is funnier still, for <em>That Awful Mess</em> is a murder/theft mystery. Two crimes occur in the same building on via Merulana, one bloodier than the first. The head <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/by-via-di-san-gregorio">investigator</a>, Ingravallo, had a crush on the murdered woman, Liliana. Liliana, or her husband, was infertile. As the doctor advised the couple, the only way to find out is to sleep around—Liliana couldn&#8217;t. In Fascist Italy, an absence of fecundity was very bad. Liliana was obsessed with her inability to bear children.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;Because that&#8217;s how the good Lord is, she said: everything to one person, and nothing to another.&#8221; And it is in this guise, indeed that He displays His mysterious perfection.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As the investigation deepens, the reader is brought to various possibilities of a guilty party then away again. Tension builds, then Gadda turns the text to chickens, or a painting, or Mussolini ( <cite>omnivisible pig</cite>, <cite>the Puppet in Palazzo Chigi</cite> ), at times with a teeth-gritting irony. A motorcycle drive to the Castelli at dawn turns as many pages as an interrogation. Gadda is doing something similar to <a href="war-and-peace-volume-3.html">Tolstoy&#8217;s Napoleon</a>, disseminating a cause to causes.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>He [Ingravallo] sustained, among other things, that unforeseen catastrophes are never the consequence or the effect, if you prefer, of a single motive, of <em>a</em> cause singular; but they are rather like a whirlpool, a cyclonic point of depression in the consciousness of the world, towards which a whole multitude of converging causes has contributed.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Who killed Liliana and robbed La Menegazzi? The Fascists, infertility, fertility, love, money, husband, cousin, nieces&#8230; What is truth then? An elusive point or multi-faceted layers of people, ideas, thoughts and matter? </p>

	<p>Two turns out my door and I&#8217;m on <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/sycamore-trunk-by-tiber-at-night">sycamore</a> lined via Merulana; now when I walk it, I can go by motorcycle at dawn with Gadda. His Rome of the vernal equinox, plagued by the sirocco, where women are burdened by ferns of <em>finocchio</em> and people burdened by poverty, depicts a Rome unsettled. Murder unsolved, truth as variegated. Carlo Emilio Gadda: nothing is as it seems</p>
