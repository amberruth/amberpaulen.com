	<p><span class="dc">S</span>o much of fiction is a delicate play between all the good forces and all the bad. It&#8217;s a theme we can&#8217;t tire of. The amount of delicacy used is the choice of the writer. Think of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, where some characters are obviously good or bad, while others—the most interesting characters—waver between their affinities. It is such indecision that grabs us because it&#8217;s something we can relate to. It&#8217;s closer to the truth of daily life and our choices. The thing is, we&#8217;re rarely placed between two moral decisions—it&#8217;s usually, which option is less bad?</p>

	<p>Most of the books I read use the weight of morality subtlety. Like in the last book I read, <a href="telegraph-avenue.html" title="Telegraph Avenue"><em>Telegraph Avenue</em> by Michael Chabon</a>. We get the character&#8217;s backstory, and under that light, how could he possibly have avoided making such bad choices? There are no clear lines, ever, like life. But this current book I&#8217;m reading steps out of that most usual treatment and deals with such issues, as the good and bad within us, very head on. </p>

	<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote <em>The Marble Faun</em> in the mid 1800s—sadly I know more about Europe at this time than the States—though I do know it was Civil War times and times of Herman Melville. Most of us ran into Hawthorne in school because of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>. I remember thinking that book boring, and maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve avoided <em>The Marble Faun</em> until now. (I picked it up because it&#8217;s <a href="book-list-books-set-in-rome.html" title="Book List: Books Set in Rome">set in Rome</a>.)</p>

	<p>In the beginning of the book (I&#8217;ve read half so far), two out of the four characters embody &#8220;good,&#8221; one is followed by the shadowy part of life, and the last has a kind of genial comfort with both. The symbolism is so obvious: white doves, white robes, Virgin shrine, sylvan dances, catacombs, dark secrets, and a mysterious envelope. At first I thought I wouldn&#8217;t like the book because everything was so straight forward, but now, as the book advances I see that this obviousness makes it interesting and that the story couldn&#8217;t have been pulled off with characters who had subtle leanings towards the light or dark.</p>

	<p>It has also made me wonder if my reaction had something to do with the lack of strongly delineated characters in much of contemporary literary fiction I&#8217;ve read. Good or bad characters usually show up in a genre novels. I don&#8217;t know enough about Gothic fiction to know if this is one of the archetypes, as <em>The Marble Faun</em> is in that category. But these characters do pose some good questions about what happens when good or bad are put in a novel that tries to get close to life. Will they, can they, remain the same throughout? Can that kind of pure virgin, white goodness survive? Anyway, I&#8217;m still reading and finding out.</p>
