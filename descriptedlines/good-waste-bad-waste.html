	<p><span class="dc">B</span>ad Waste: Waste: <cite>To use, consume, or expend thoughtlessly or carelessly; squander.</cite> &#8220;We live in a disposable world,&#8221; so said someone to me lately. My jaw dropped in disbelief for shock came up over me and washed into my mouth on a wave; I responded, &#8220;That&#8217;s not what my father taught me.&#8221; I was taught that everything is used until it is finished.</p>

	<p>I think he who said such a thing wanted to shove the blame of disposability onto the products he bought; I think he wanted to not feel <em>as</em> bad for creating so much trash. Waste is made. And though our society encourages fly-by night treats wrapped in plastic, coffee bought in paper cups, plastic bags, plastic bottles, plastic toys, aluminum cans, paper wrapped, candy wrapped, shrink-wrapped bounties, we should feel shame for clogging the earth&#8217;s pores. After all, &#8220;We love because He first loved us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Haste makes waste,&#8221; is the old adage. We tumble through our lives at an ever increasing break-neck speed. Back in the old days it was easy: silverware was made of silver and tin cans out of tin. Now it&#8217;s all made out of plastic and we can&#8217;t but help ourselves to think: plastic is trash, cheap shit is trash, because in essence <em>it is.</em> That&#8217;s why we have been given some choice, a free-will, a brain to make decisions for all our choices have outcomes.  </p>

	<p>My dad used to tell me of his tribulations. His dad was even more of a hard-ass for waste than my own. His dad put water in the catsup and squirted it on the french fries. Now my dad doesn&#8217;t eat french fries and cuts the plastic top off the catsup so that he can get at all those hard-to-get gobs and streaks; now my dad puts water in the dishsoap and I do too. </p>

	<p>There are of course &#8220;the movements&#8221; and as long as one doesn&#8217;t get tangled in jargon and &#8220;rules,&#8221; – for all groups, -isms and -ists, are the same — they are OK. Movements coming to us from our life-soldiering sisters and brothers evenly distributed along the States&#8217; most westernly and most easternly coasts: <a href="http://www.ecologycenter.org/ffc/">organic marketers</a>, fair-traders, raw-foodists, recycle advocates, sustainability preachers. They all have small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_footprint">&#8216;ecological footprints,&#8217;</a> as they say.</p>

	<p>Good Waste: Waste: <cite>a. A useless or worthless by-product. b. Something, as steam, that escapes without being used.</cite> Life makes waste. Like <a href="pilgrim-on-tinker-creek.html">Annie Dillard</a> said, it is death which breeds fecundity, it is death that keeps us going. That senseless waste abounds is a condition of which we have zero control. And that&#8217;s OK, because I wouldn&#8217;t be able to so acknowledge my life as such, without it.</p>

	<p>I got thinking about waste, good and bad, after my friend said such a shocking thing and after I had to again throw away another stack of papers. Art makes waste and the waste is like steam for it pushes me forward ever forward. If I decided to keep all that shitty writing I would be wallowing about in the quagmire, wondering and backtracking, thinking, &#8220;What went wrong?&#8221;</p>

	<p>As <a href="http://www.simongriffee.com/">Simon</a> says, &#8220;Waste is part of the process.&#8221; It&#8217;s unavoidable, it&#8217;s good and bad and in-between all at the same time and there&#8217;s nothing that we can do about it but use what we have been given until it&#8217;s finished.</p>
