	<p>Yesterday I woke (late) with an urge to finally see what that Eataly thing is all about. I&#8217;ve seen the canvas shopper bags dangling off young shoulders and I&#8217;ve heard about Eataly: a big supermarket with restaurants is how it&#8217;s most often described. I&#8217;ve discussed the concept: Isn&#8217;t it ridiculous to try to market Italian food to Italians? Why does Rome need an all-Italy supermarket when every bread maker, cheese and meat slicer, butcher, fish vendor, and <a href="best-in-rome-grapes.html" title="Best in Rome: Grapes">fruit and veggie man</a> and woman is already selling full-blooded Italian products to Italians? You got me. </p>

	<p>Something I must iterate before getting into the Eataly experience is that large supermarkets are relatively new in Italy. As more and more Italians live in suburbs and drive cars, the supermarket&#8217;s popularity has increased. But there is still a big portion of the population who will walk from one store to another (yes, walk, even the eighty-year-old grandmas) to pick up each product from its appropriate vendor. For me, this is one of the major pleasures of eating in Italy. Then of course, there&#8217;s the food that is always top-notch because of its freshness and simplicity. I&#8217;ve had the pig butcher tell me the sausage I was buying had been made from a pig that was running around that very morning, bread is always out of the oven, and fruit ripens on trees.</p>

	<p>Eataly dominates a previously abandoned building—where the new Italo train line has also wedged in an office—on the Garbatella side of Ostiense Station. Mussolini had the station built for Hitler&#8217;s arrival into town, and the building still retains much of that <a href="fascist-rome.html" title="Fascist Rome">Fascist charm</a> even down to the graffiti tags and never functioning escalators. If you&#8217;re headed to Eataly from inside the Aurelian walls, a walk through Ostiense Station is your port of entry. And then you&#8217;re there, standing outside the glittering new-old building; then you&#8217;re swept inside on a crowd. </p>

	<p>Immediately it was apparent that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought Sunday was a good time to go to Eataly. The place was packed, so that at first all I saw were heads and heard was children. And then the inner-skeleton of the place began to take form: shimmering (working) escalators drew shoppers and their carts upwards by the dozens, rows and shelves of shiny upscale sauces, mixed in with a café, and look there, a <em>pasticeria</em>! And over there, a beer garden! A <em>friggitoria</em>! Sliced meats and cheeses! Rows and rows of fancy pasta! A bookstore! What is this place?</p>

	<p>But Simon and I were too hungry to walk around amongst that many people, so we quickly found a seat in the nearest thing to a restaurant. I ordered a <em>pasta di mare</em> and Simon had the lunch special. While we ate we began to talk. &#8220;It reminds me of an Ikea.&#8221; &#8220;At least it employs an age group in desperate need of jobs.&#8221; &#8220;The bread is tasty.&#8221; &#8220;My pasta is good.&#8221; &#8220;I can see why it&#8217;s popular in the States.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s so new and shiny and commercial—&#8221;</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s what bothers me about Eataly: the consumer frenzy that I&#8217;ve deplored as an American in the States has always felt worse to me in its manifestations outside that country. Eataly, Eataly, Eataly is posted everywhere, on t-shirts and bags and the walls. It&#8217;s not food or even Italian food back to Italians that Eataly wants to sell, but itself over and over again. Selling itself as the best new, big box-shop-that&#8217;s-more-than-a-shop because it&#8217;s a whole experience. After grabbing a free sample of something sweet, Simon and I headed for the exit. </p>

	<p>Later in the evening I started to think about Eataly again and was reminded of a market we haven&#8217;t visited since last spring. On a side street off a corner of Circo Massimo is the Campania Amica market that sets up every weekend. Farmers bring in their fruit and veggies; there&#8217;s a porchetta guy, cheese and meat people, and someone selling potted flowers and herbs. Every weekend one farm organizes and cooks up a slim lunch menu that you get <em>tavola calda</em> style and eat on long wooden benches, communal style. There is a quiet humility about the place even when it&#8217;s packed and loud and the farmers are irritable. Here are people making a living by selling what they know how to do. They&#8217;re not selling themselves as anything besides farmers, and their <em>clemintini</em> are nothing more than that, <em>clemintini</em> fresh off the tree. </p>

	<p>But I&#8217;ll try to finish on a bright note: if 8:00 pm to midnight ever comes around and finds me in desperate need of ingredients for dinner, instead of making due with the Bangladeshi stand down the street, I can head over to Eataly and pick up some vegetables, cheese, or meat. But wait . . . I weigh the two options: Supporting the Bangladeshi who supports his family out of his small stand or finding my way through Ostiense station to support a big box-shop? Maybe not. Maybe Barilla and tomato for dinner is just fine.</p>
