	<p><img src="_images/312.jpg" alt="Simone de Beauvoir&#039;s The Prime of Life" width="500" height="375" /></p>

	<p class="caption">A well-read copy of &#8220;The Prime of Life&#8221; by Simone de Beauvoir among the boxes.</p>

	<p><span class="dc">I</span> have spent the last weeks reading Simone de Beauvoir&#8217;s <em>The Prime of Life</em> for the third time. The first time I read it I hadn&#8217;t started writing but knew I wanted to start and was waiting and looking for an apartment where I could start. I had left Michigan the year before and had somehow ended up in Rome. De Beauvoir&#8217;s book proved to me that I wasn&#8217;t mistaken in believing firmly in my independence, in my individualistic search for who and what I am. Reading it now, I&#8217;m still blown away by her insistent individualism—this unmistakable sense of knowing that what you&#8217;re doing is okay because you&#8217;re following what you believe (a belief often difficult to dig to the bottom of). </p>

	<p>Now, like then, I&#8217;m grateful for how she writes about her persistent goal to be a writer, which seems to go hand in hand with her persistence to get the most out of life. I had forgotten how many bad novels she wrote before publishing <em>She Came to Stay</em>, when she was in her mid-thirties, during the end of World War II. I had forgotten about her long walks through the French countryside, walks that lasted weeks, where she and Sartre would sleep outside under a grove of trees, or she would sleep alone in a hut in the mountains. But I hadn&#8217;t really forgotten about the walks or her determination to be a writer because it was these things that I understood the most and found the most reassurance in.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>What I wanted was to penetrate so deeply into other people&#8217;s lives that when they heard my voice they would get the impression they were talking to themselves.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I read that last night and it is probably the best description of how I feel when I read and read (past tense) de Beauvoir—that I am talking to myself. At any age, such a voice is like a home.</p>

	<p>But I haven&#8217;t only been reading <em>The Prime of Life</em> these last weeks. I&#8217;ve been getting ready to leave Italy, to <a href="goodbye-to-all-that.html" title="Goodbye to All That">move to New York City</a>, to begin studying at Columbia University. I have put my books in boxes, gotten rid of lots <a href="stuff-part-i.html" title="Stuff, Part I">of stuff</a> and eaten good food and drank good wine with good people whom I won&#8217;t see for a while. In two weeks we&#8217;ll be there. It is a strange move for me in that I can already picture more or less the structure of my days: studying, going to classes and maybe even working in a bookstore. </p>

	<p>Though, of course, I have no idea what this move will bring, what it will change for me and my writing. It is still very much an adventure—moving back to the States after nearly a decade in Europe, going back to university after dropping out 14 years ago, living in New York City. It is very appropriate that I have been reading Simone de Beauvoir before I toss myself into all this. She brings me confidence that I&#8217;m not crazy but that I&#8217;m simply still searching for who and what I am.</p>
