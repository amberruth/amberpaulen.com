	<p><span class="dc">I</span> read about the life of Simone de Beauvoir with inexplicable enjoyment, some goad pushed me on: I am fantasized. Of this woman&#8217;s life there is much I want to know: as part of the French intelligentsia, anything to do with Paris, her relationship with <a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/sartre_1.jpg">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, existentialism, <em>The Second Sex</em>, <a href="http://www.millerwalks.com/le-dome/">le Dôme</a> or <a href="http://www.parisenimages.fr/fr/popup-photo.html?photo=229-3">la Coupole</a> at night, her famous friends, love affairs, travel, staunch <a href="http://tsutpen.blogspot.com/2007/08/artists-in-action-235.html">protests</a> of war, politics, communism, Castro.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>At the most, if my books are still read, the reader will think: There wasn&#8217;t much she didn&#8217;t see!</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><em>Force of Circumstance</em> is Simone de Beauvoir&#8217;s third autobiography, originally published in two volumes, it is long. <em>The Prime of Life</em> (her second) I read twice in a row; it was a book that influenced me deeply, especially during those first stages of trying to think myself as &#8220;writer.&#8221; There was so much vital development in Simone&#8217;s younger autobiography as she found herself, the writer, after leaving school at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a>. In comparison much of <em>Force of Circumstance</em> seems already settled—not that that time in her life was; the book gives way to the resignation of older age.</p>

	<p>After fifty pages I determined the pattern: personal life, theater/arts and a big chunk of politics, repeat. Perhaps it was the lengthy dragging of politics that bored me the most—all those acronyms cause inscrutability—though the theatre has also been known to put me asleep. </p>

	<p>In all those stale politics that did not at second glance appear so outdated, I was made to wonder: How much are we determined by our time? Is it the current state of politics that effects us or the crummy nature of politics in general? I can&#8217;t help comparing all bad things to other bad things, like Germans in Paris or French in Algeria or Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>

	<p>The whole of <em>Volume II: Hard Times</em> is devoted more or less to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War">war in Algeria</a>. Where <em>Volume I: After the War</em> is hopeful, the second volume shatters any hope for <em>the good</em> of humanity into a myriad of depressing pieces. For those of of us who have become numb to the horrors of our time there is much to learn from Simone de Beauvoir&#8217;s sensitive reaction to that colonial war. That France, so recently released from Hitler&#8217;s fascist grasp would turn and become fascist itself: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_massacre_of_1961">massacres</a>, genocides, torture, starvation, labor camps, death, murder, death. That fellow humans turned their faces sunk Simone de Beauvoir into despair. A sadness that gave way to her own old age, more death.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>For now I know the truth of the human condition: two-thirds of mankind are hungry. My species is two-thirds composed of worms, too weak to ever rebel, who drag their way from birth to death through a perpetual dusk of despair.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>My favorite parts were the descriptions of her travels. With enough money in her and Sartre&#8217;s pockets they went to China, Algeria, Brazil, Communist Russia, the <span class="caps">USA</span>, Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba. She had a keen eye and a memory like a basket. Then there were the numerous road trips and summers in Rome. <cite>Rome: a place where what we must call beauty is the most ordinary thing in the world.</cite> Rome: where a million eyes have rested and each time one may know something new.</p>

	<p>To walk through the piazza before the <a href="http://romebw.com/category/places/pantheon">Pantheon</a> and know her and Sartre sat there every morning for coffee and the papers, is to know they drew a similar solace. She touched what I can still touch. That they were here in Bracciano and caught <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/scene-at-belvedere-della-sentinella">the view</a> over the lake and admired the <a href="http://simongriffee.com/story-felb/braccianos-dog-and-castle">Castello</a> is fortifying: I see her shadow. I see this woman walking through the streets, experiencing their beauty.</p>

	<p>Then there is Simone&#8217;s relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre, a relationship not of the slightest curiosity. In the first sentence of the epilogue she writes: <cite>There has been one undoubted success in my life: my relationship with Sartre.</cite> Their relationships was what we call &#8220;open,&#8221; though in those days there was no name for it. They slept with other people and after a certain amount of time stopped sleeping with each other. They shared most everything about each other&#8217;s lovers and even went out to dinner together, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2005/03/15/books/0316books-sartre.html">all four</a>! </p>

	<p>Besides from the <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=95">sleeping-with-other-people</a> part, the relationship between Simone and Sartre was bigger than what most modern couples achieve. Not simply because they were similar in occupation but that they met each other equally, they were challenged by each other, respected the other, one&#8217;s own work fed the other&#8217;s work. Simone de Beauvoir wrote of Sartre as if he were a vital part of herself, transparent, he illuminated more about the woman I was eager to know.</p>

	<p>The epilogue to <em>Force of Circumstance</em> is dire indeed. There are no illusions of false-hope: only old age and eventual death. <cite>Nothing will have taken place.</cite> As I read the epilogue my heart leapt. I couldn&#8217;t believe that this solemn and beautiful chapter was the way the author of <em>The Prime of Life</em> was going to end it. Perhaps I&#8217;ve become so accustomed to <a href="henry-miller.html">Henry Miller&#8217;s</a> striking optimism to believe Simone de Beauvoir, a lover of life, would scorn old age. </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>To grow old is to set limits on one&#8217;s self, to shrink. </p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Simone de Beauvoir was a &#8220;woman of her time,&#8221; whatever that means! Like <a href="doris-lessing.html">Doris Lessing</a> she never lets on that writing is not a lot of <a href="the-process.html">work</a>. Her devotion to her craft was steadfast. It is these women I have in mind when I think of the writer I would like to become. Though many of Simone de Beauvoir&#8217;s novels have slipped into an obscurity, I believe her autobiographies and of course <em>The Second Sex</em>, will remain. It is not only the woman as writer I find so interesting but the person with a deep and complex life that eclipses all.</p>
