	<h2>Fiction</h2>

	<h3><a href="clash-of-civilizations-over-an-elevator-in-piazza-vittorio.html"><em>Clash of Civilizations Over an Elevator in Piazza Vittorio</em></a> by Amara Lakhous </h3>

	<p>Published in Italian in 2006, this book describes a great contemporary cross-section of the city set into a murder mystery. </p>

	<h3><a href="daisy-miller.html"><em>Daisy Miller</em></a> by Henry James</h3>

	<p>A great little novella about a young American flirt. Half of it is set in Rome.</p>

	<h3>Short stories by <a href="http://amberpaulen.com/descriptedlines/john-cheever%3A" title="John Cheever">John Cheever</a> &#8220;Boy in Rome,&#8221; &#8220;The World of Apples&#8221; and &#8220;The Bella Lingua&#8221;</h3>

	<p>John Cheever lived in Rome for about a year, in the Piazza Venezia. His experience served him in drawing the sometimes beguiling experience of the expat abroad. </p>

	<h3><a href="stories-from-the-city-of-god.html" title="Stories From the City of God "><em>Stories From the City of God: Sketches and Chronicles of Rome 1950-1966</em></a> by Pier Paolo Pasolini</h3>

	<p>This short collection contains rich stories and non-fiction that describe Pasolini&#8217;s Rome of the post-war years.</p>

	<h3><a href="that-awful-mess-on-the-via-merulana.html" title="That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana"><em>That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana</em></a> by Carlo Emilio Gadda</h3>

	<p>Published in Italian in 1957, <em>That Awful Mess</em> is another murder mystery, this time during the reign of Mussolini. Gadda paints a very different Rome in very sublime language.</p>

	<h3><a href="the-imperfectionists.html" title="The Imperfectionists"><em>The Imperfectionists</em></a> by Tom Rachman</h3>

	<p>Not a bad book considering it&#8217;s debatable whether or not this book is even set in Rome.</p>

	<h3><em>The Marble Faun</em> by Nathaniel Hawthorne</h3>

	<p>First published in 1860, <em>The Marble Faun</em> describes what happens when an innocent Roman meets a mysterious expat with a tainted history. I really thought this book would be much more boring than it actually was. The drama builds like all good books, and kept me flipping pages until I was done. <a href="good-and-bad-in-the-marble-faun.html" title="Good and Bad in The Marble Faun">Here are some thoughts on it.</a></p>

	<h3><a href="the-roman-spring-of-mrs-stone.html" title="The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone "><em>The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone</em></a> by Tennessee Williams </h3>

	<p>The Rome of Tennessee Williams is that of a bored and rich American widow who oscillates between the possibility of a bought affair with a much younger Italian man.</p>

	<h3><a href="when-we-were-romans.html"><em>When We Were Romans</em></a> by Matthew Kneale</h3>

	<p>An excellent read mostly set in contemporary Rome. Told from the perspective of a young child, the novel&#8217;s balance between what readers know and what they don&#8217;t builds until the end. This is a good book to read in Rome over a weekend trip.</p>

	<h2>Historical Fiction</h2>

	<h3><a href="augustus.html" title="Augustus"><em>Augustus</em></a> by John Williams </h3>

	<p>The fictional life of Octavian Caesar as told through letters and journals of those who surrounded the first Emperor. A beautiful book.</p>

	<h3><a href="i-claudius.html" title="I, Claudius"><em>I, Claudius</em></a> by Robert Graves </h3>

	<p>Claudius tells the story of the Julio-Claudian family in all its ugly and mesmerizing details.</p>

	<h3><a href="memoirs-of-hadrian-x-2.html" title="Memoirs of Hadrian x 2"><em>Memoirs of Hadrian</em></a> by Marguerite Yourcenar </h3>

	<p>Yourcenar evokes Hadrian&#8217;s life with poetry. The most Greek of all the Emperors, his love of art, Antinous and his desire to create an Empire without war, makes me want to believe in the truth of this fictitious account.</p>

	<h2>Non-fiction</h2>

	<h3><a href="a-day-in-the-life-of-ancient-rome.html" title="A Day in the Life of Ancient Rome"><em>A Day in the Life of Ancient Rome</em></a> by Alberto Angela </h3>

	<p>An entertaining introduction to life in the Roman Empire at the height of power.</p>

	<h3><em>Classical Art: From Greece to Rome</em> by Mary Beard and John Henderson </h3>

	<p>This book was essential for me in understanding all the ancient bits and revamped statues around the city. There are also useful timelines and maps at the back.</p>

	<h3><a href="italian-journey.html" title="Italian Journey"><em>Italian Journey</em></a> by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe </h3>

	<p>An indispensable book for anyone wishing to journey into Italy. Goethe spent about a year in Rome living off the Corso. His observations are lively and complete a picture of Rome during the late eighteenth century. </p>

	<h3><em>Michelangelo and the Pope&#8217;s Ceiling</em> by Ross King</h3>

	<p>This book tells all you could want to know about the creation of the Sistine Chapel, not enough about the man who painted it and more about the pope who commissioned it. Also good for describing the time period in which Michelangelo painted one of his many masterpieces.</p>

	<h3><em>Mussolini&#8217;s Rome: Rebuilding the Eternal City</em> by Borden Painter </h3>

	<p>This book wasn&#8217;t especially well-written, but it provides enough information to determine the Fascist landscape of Rome and how that was created under Mussolini. I can&#8217;t walk around Rome in the same way again.</p>

	<h3><em>Rome: The Biography of A City</em> by Christopher Hibbert</h3>

	<p>This relatively thin book spans the thick history of Rome, from the myth of Romulus and Remus to the dictatorship of Mussolini. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t own it, but I enjoy dipping into it at the library whenever I can. It seems the best book available for the most information.</p>

	<h3><em>Rome: Profile of a City, 312-1308</em> by Richard Krautheimer </h3>

	<p>Currently reading. From Late Christianity through the Middle Ages, Rome forms and transforms under the political backdrop of Byzantine to&#8230; I&#8217;m still reading.</p>

	<h3><a href="the-twelve-caesars.html" title="The Twelve Caesars"><em>The Twelve Caesars</em></a> by Suetonius </h3>

	<p>The translation by Robert Graves is lively and entertaining. The Caesars were often crazy.</p>

	<p>And if you have any suggestions, please drop a note&#8230;</p>
