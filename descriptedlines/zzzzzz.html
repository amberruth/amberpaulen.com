	<p><span class="dc">T</span>hat&#8217;s this blog hibernating. This late winter sees me in full swing. I&#8217;ve started up my editing certification courses again and I&#8217;m working, working. In two weeks I&#8217;ll be in the States for two weeks, and then I would like to start up descriptedlines again. </p>

	<p>But I can&#8217;t put the blog to sleep without a few notes. Simon has been busy on my professional site: <a href="http://amberpaulen.com/">amberpaulen.com</a>. Not that anything will be going on there either, but I might as well start linking to it.</p>

	<p>I finished a Carson McCullers spree on Sunday. I first read the massive <em>The Lonely Hunter</em> by Virginia Spencer Carr. It&#8217;s a one-stop resource for anything you want to know about the life of Carson McCullers. Her quick success and her intense personality and her struggles with her writings. The only thing I wanted a little more of, and something <a href="cheever.html" title="Cheever">Bailey&#8217;s <em>Cheever</em></a> biography excelled in, was a breakdown of her works. Carr wrote about them as if the reader had already pored over McCullers&#8217;s bibliography, which wasn&#8217;t my case. But maybe that&#8217;s what drove me immediately from the biography to <em>The Member of the Wedding</em>. A book that&#8217;s the opposite in size to the biography, but massive in many more ways. It was one of the most carefully written and drawn out books I think I&#8217;ve read. McCullers&#8217;s prose seemed so controlled, and the development of Frankie to F. Jasmine to Frances was absolutely exquisite, which made it almost disturbing. It was a novel to come back to, that will reveal more of itself over several readings.</p>

	<p>And lastly: Thanks <a href="http://kimberlysullivan.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/the-addictive-blog-award/">Kimberly for the Addictive Blog Award</a>!</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m required to say why I write here and I guess the answer is because I hope people will read what I write and somehow be interested in it in one way or another. I&#8217;ve had descriptedlines for almost six years and it&#8217;s the best place for me to &#8220;publish&#8221; when I feel like it. I don&#8217;t write it for popularity or notice or anything like that. And I might even say I write for that single, devoted reader whom I&#8217;m so happy still checks this site. Thanks single dear reader for keeping me afloat! </p>

	<p>Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have ten blogs I recommend, but I do have some sites that I read:</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.themillions.com/%3A">The Millions</a> My favorite place for book coverage online. Almost more than the articles I like the quick bits from around the web on the lower left-hand side.</p>

	<p><a href="http://theasylum.wordpress.com/%3A">John Self&#8217;s Asylum</a> Asylum is another place I go for some good reading recommendations. It&#8217;s the first place I read about Matthew Kneale, and there are so many other books John Self has read that I would like to dig into too.</p>

	<p>Occasionally, in the past, I&#8217;ve been known to read <a href="http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/">Vulpes Libris</a> and <a href="http://evesalexandria.typepad.com/">Eve&#8217;s Alexandria</a>. </p>

	<p>And of course, there&#8217;s the daily photograph from <a href="http://simongriffee.com/">Simon</a>.</p>
