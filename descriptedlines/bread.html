	<p><span class="dc">W</span>hen in the beginning I gave myself a typewriter and sat myself down to write I struggled. I was writing a book and I was also writing page long treaties most days which were my bread that kept me going. As always true to form I will transcribe as typewritten five years ago.</p>

	<p>july nine<br />
full tummy, heads all empty and i don&#8217;t care<br />
i haven&#8217;t been writing very much lately, some words here and there, but nothing sustaining. if i&#8217;m feeling hopeless and shiftless it&#8217;s my own fault. but i shouldn&#8217;t slack on my writing. if i want to stay alive i have to feed myself, keep my mind healthy which is best done right here. maybe i&#8217;m scared of the solitude i endure when i sit here hour after hour, scared that i&#8217;ll lose experiences if i remain; when nothing else should be as important as what i can create with my mind, the words i can let flow. so, drown, submerge, whatever must be done or i will no doubt loose what i started. i felt alive when i first started writing, empowered by my creating, but then i felt this was not sustaining enough, but it is. true, my money is running low, but where did the term starving artist come from? i can&#8217;t subject myself to the pointlessness of getting a job, then i shall surely drown, surely loose what i have started. i will loose the belief in what i am doing for a fucking lousy buck. i can&#8217;t think it&#8217;s me vs. society, that does me no good either, well, it&#8217;s not that i&#8217;m against society for that&#8217;s the best point of reference, the best launch into myself, a reflection of a high degree. (Henry Miller says: Everything external is but a reflection projected by the mind machine.) and it&#8217;s not as if i need to embrace society either, all i need to do is to reap from it. be the gypsy, take and take, so that one day i may give. i have my own answers, i can&#8217;t be afraid to look them in the eye with a penetrating realization. i need to breathe through my words, inhale, exhale, i am. to loose this power would be self-defeating to give in to the other powers without the strength of this one would be just as bad. as much as writing requires that i live inside myself i need to live outside, i need to find the correct balance. i&#8217;m 23 years old, living in rome with the infinity of my life before me, limited and unlimited and only the realization of it as such is standing in my way. today i knew i was going to write, yesterday i wanted to but the world got the better of me and then i feel bad, like spending my last money.  i can traverse through foreign countries, thinking and self-reflecting all the while but when i choose to settle down, to own things, to have constants, i get lost. when i see a number of things on a continuum of static being i fall into the same. i forget my own becoming, it becomes less important and it isn&#8217;t. it is all that i have, however intimidating and tedious. when the outside opposition dwindles, i give in and pronounce that there is nothing to be opposed to because i have failed to see that the biggest opposition i face and will ever face is myself. so, as i wrote in tunisia, here is my bucket. my well is open and tumultuous and all i have to do is to face it, eyes wide shut.</p>
