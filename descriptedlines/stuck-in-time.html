	<p><span class="dc">O</span>ur world is laden with possibilities.  This is a cliche and it is true. The internet lessens gaps between what we <em>want</em> to see and what we <em>can</em> see, considerably.  I get the feeling that this coming generation will believe that all things come at the touch of a button and that the differences, for them, between reality and what is on the glowing screen will be less and less clear. But, isn&#8217;t everyone always fearful for the &#8220;coming generations?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Around this time last year I discovered blogs. I charted my discovery <a href="ephemera/internet-no-2.html">here</a>. Before last year I thought that the internet was used to locate hard to locate information. That I am a slow learner is of little importance to me; that I learn is the biggest deal.</p>

	<p>This website was created as an effort to &#8220;publish&#8221; my work, give voice to my voice. Before I discovered blogs I thought this was a website and though some may call it &#8220;blog,&#8221; I don&#8217;t care anymore. I see <a href="/descriptedlines/">descriptedlines</a> like a magazine wherein I may &#8220;publish&#8221; thoughtful articles. Who knows, maybe eventually I&#8217;ll get the hang of shorter posts like an interesting link and a sentence, but sometimes I think I&#8217;m already in too deep.</p>

	<p>Here is my point: I am behind the times.</p>

	<p>I was advancing OK until round about the age of 22 when I became waterlogged in Paris during the 1930s. I went back to Russia in the 1890s sometimes but really it was Paris in the 1930s for a very long time. Three years, at least, I&#8217;ve lost to this reverse-time stint. Of course I&#8217;m not talking about Paris on picture postcards; I was knee deep in <a href="obsession-and-awe.html">Henry Miller&#8217;s Paris</a>, <a href="anais-nin.html">Anaïs Nin</a>, Lawrence Durrell, <a href="simone-de-beauvoir.html">Simone de Beauvoir</a>, Jean Paul Sartre. Names that spun-up my mind, worked up my senses to such a froth that I had no choice but to hold my head under cold water, write a treatise, or drink. Paris in the 1930s was an unbelievable time, the raw fecundity which gave birth to such staggering creations, well, I still believe there is nothing else to aspire to but that.</p>

	<p>Since Paris I&#8217;ve advanced rather slowly, Rhodesia in the 1940s, England in the 1950s, now it&#8217;s a creek in The States in the 1970s, but reading aside&#8230; This is actually <em>about</em> reading and how it creates a very tangible actuality for the active mind; me knee deep in another time. Nothing else can do this but when knee deep in the heightened present.</p>

	<p>Listening to <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=293">this This American Life</a> last night I began to think that for all my preaching, I may be at a serious disadvantage.  I have a staunch disability to reconcile with <a href="http://amberpaulen.com/descriptedlines/on-why-im-not-on-facebook">Facebook</a> and if anything is a sign of the times it must be that. I have difficulty finding blogs interesting and a worthwhile waste of time, unless of course they are dumb and then I find them funny. I can&#8217;t comment. I&#8217;ve never used chat or IM and I have no idea what those acronyms mean or the brackets with the colons. I am at a disadvantage: I am behind the times.</p>

	<p>I am at an advantage: I am behind the times. What I have stacked in a folder to my side is a <a href="tblm/index.html">completely original work</a>. . . or an anchor and when I jump. . . it will become lighter than me, off on its own life, its own path.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Annie Dillard&#8217;s <a href="pilgrim-on-tinker-creek.html"><em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em></a>. She supplies me with lots of juicy things to think about. Her main entomologist is <a href="http://naturewriting.com/edwinway.htm">Edwin Way Teale</a>, just his name sounds old and outdated and Annie Dillard won the Pulitzer Prize. I&#8217;ve never read a writer &#8220;up on the latest&#8221; but then I again, I haven&#8217;t read many books published after my birth. I&#8217;m at a disadvantage again.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Time chugs on; meanwhile, I&#8217;m grasping for its tail.</p>
