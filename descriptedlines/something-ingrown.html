	<p><span class="dc">T</span>he other morning I woke up to the dream that a short story had been accepted by a literary journal called Camera Obscura. When I checked my inbox later that morning, I saw there was an email from the literary journal Camera Obscura. I opened it to the same response: I&#8217;m sorry, unfortunately, etc. My dream got the journal right just not its verdict, though I would rather have hopeful, untruthful dreams any night.</p>

	<p>Some retrospect on writing: about a year ago I finished a manuscript with understandable excitement. I had written the thing for myself, paying very little attention to the written world published around me. Then I went brushing up against that world with expectations. <em>Oh la la!</em> It&#8217;s not that easy. And I don&#8217;t think it ever will be. Humans are not programmed to receive rejection and continue on in that direction, unless we&#8217;re heedless, tough-skinned fellows, which a writer has got to be. A writer has got to be confident even if there is little to be confident about but an ingrown belief in some words composed. </p>

	<p>Rejection has its benefits. I feel it, the restlessness of my work. I can&#8217;t get comfortable. I&#8217;m squirming around in a potential fantasy, pushing my writing over its previous edges. <em>And now for something completely different!</em> That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m repeating to myself all the the time. I&#8217;m getting excited. I&#8217;m letting the excitement build-up, frenetic molecules of thought-ideas bashing into each other, shooting off to some place unthought. Let the beauty of this catastrophe come tinkling down like light of a dying star. </p>
