	<p><span class="dc">C</span>ontinuing on through my favorite places around Rome is (surprise!) another bookshop. I have book-browsed the shelves of <a href="http://www.aab.it/">The Anglo-American Book Co.</a> on Via della Vite, 102, for as long as I have been in Rome. While the <a href="rome-s-best-english-bookshop-open-door-bookshop.html" title="Rome&#39;s Best English Bookshop: Open Door Bookshop">Open Door Bookshop</a> is for sessions of book buying adventure, never knowing what bound treasure I&#8217;ll find, Anglo-American Book stocks what&#8217;s new. It can&#8217;t compare to those giant shops in the States—those dizzying shelves and shelves and rooms and stacks of new books. But I&#8217;ve always left with at least a list in my head of more books I want to read.</p>

	<p>Besides from recently published there is an excellent literature and art section; a mouth-watering area of Italian writers—I&#8217;ve been eyeing Elsa Morante&#8217;s <em>History</em> for the last six months; and an impressive wall of black Penguin Classics bordered by silver Penguin Modern Classics. </p>

	<p>It was a book of the latter that I bought yesterday, Virginia Woolf&#8217;s <em>Orlando</em>. On the bus back home I read some of Sarah Gilbert&#8217;s introduction. Apparently I read enough for Virginia Woolf to visit my dreams, where I told her that I haven&#8217;t read any of her books before, but was going to start with <em>Orlando</em>, wasn&#8217;t that strange? She didn&#8217;t seem to think so. Though I still wonder if <em>To the Lighthouse</em> wouldn&#8217;t be the best of her bibliography to begin with? We took a very small plane ride together, then she disintegrated.</p>

	<p>Anglo-American Book Co. has been in Rome in one form or another since 1953. Though it&#8217;s not as small and family run as the Open Door, it maintains its independent spirit, though I do wish it would maintain more titles from independent presses—impossible or extremely difficult to find in Rome. No matter, Anglo-American Book has the bread and butter for any decent book collection.</p>

	<p><em>Via della Vite, 120, near the Spanish Steps; +39 06 6795222; closed Sundays</em></p>
