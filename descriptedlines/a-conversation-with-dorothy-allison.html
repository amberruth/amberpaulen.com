	<p><span class="dc">L</span>ast night when Dorothy Allison walked into the room for <a href="fiction-reading-dorothy-allison.html">a second time</a> I was no longer shocked at how her size didn&#8217;t reach the monolith in my mind. She took a seat between the two academics. Sarcasm breezed across her face as they listed her long achievements, again. She recounted an incident before a reading that her sister attended, who shouted in response to such a list, &#8220;Who do you think you are? Some kind of Renaissance woman!&#8221; (Remember the southern accent.)</p>

	<p>Then the conversation got underway. Questions were posed, back and forth between two professors, one <a href="http://www.carlosdews.com/">Carlos Dews</a>, whose personal statement at the beginning made clear Allison&#8217;s influence on his work, and another whose name I have no clue. I can&#8217;t remember much about the questions, but that they were good and elicited good answers. </p>

	<p>What I remember (and wrote down): </p>

	<ul>
		<li>When Dorothy Allison lived in <span class="caps">NYC</span> she was politically active, working as an editor at <a href="http://www.pw.org/">Poets and Writers</a> and writing— <em>Trash</em> came out of this period. She recalled having twenty paid days off of work and using them to write the story <em>The Gospel Song</em>: her fiction became longer and more complex.</li>
		<li>The origins of <a href="bastard-out-of-carolina.html"><em>Bastard Out of Carolina</em></a> are in a nasty review of a book by Mab Segrest, <em>My Mama&#8217;s Dead Squirrel</em>. Allison thought that if the reviewer found those essays shocking then she wanted to give the reviewer a heart attack.</li>
		<li><em>Bastard</em> took ten years to finish and 39 revisions.</li>
		<li>Allison set out to write &#8220;working class fiction in complicated ways.&#8221;</li>
		<li>The first time Allison met <a href="toni-morrison.html">Toni Morrison</a> was by lying her way into Random House. Toni Morrison stood super-human with confidence and conviction. She immediately saw that Allison had been lying, who slunk away unable to remember why she had come.</li>
		<li>She recalled when <em>Bastard Out of Carolina</em> was being made into a movie by Anjelica Huston. She doesn&#8217;t recommend the movie world to any writer, though it was with the movie rights that she was able to afford her house in Northern California.</li>
		<li>She talked for awhile about her upcoming novel, <em>She Who</em>. How she created a character based on the well-off students of Stanford, out of a class prejudice, then threw her off a building. About how she couldn&#8217;t write for two years and what kind of torture that is for a writer.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Then she got up to stand behind the podium—she said writers <em>need</em> to exercise and stretch—to read another short story entitled <em>Jason</em>. Again, her story and her voice strung me along; I envisioned what she was telling so vividly before me: the dust on Jason&#8217;s boots and the basement he wanted to get locked into to emerge brilliant and finally, loved. Dorothy Allison&#8217;s stories are heart rending. I almost started crying.</p>
